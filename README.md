This Machine Learning Crash Course uses Colaboratories (Colabs) for all programming exercises. Colab is Google's implementation of [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). 



*   While the ProjectDemiurge Software uses **MACHINES LEARNING** on a 
dataset of IMAGES this notebook features **MACHINES LEARNING** on a simple dataset. The principles involved in tuning the **HYPERPARAMETERS** are the same. 
*   With ProjectDemiurge Software (even though there are no graphs to analyze) when the model does not converge the person in the generated images may not look like the subject. 


*  When the model converges the IMAGES generated will look more like th subject.
